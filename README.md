# auphanSoftware-codeChallenge

## Overview
Create a fake login page using PHP, HTML, and jQuery.

Meets the following requirements:
- 1. Has a place for the username, password and a login button.
- 2. The username, password and login button are placed inside a box and centered horizontally and vertically in the page.   
- 3. Use CSS classes, no use of style attributes.
- 4. Uses ajax to submit the username and password for verification.
- 5. If the username submitted is hr@auphansoftware.com and password is hello, 
   then show a message saying "Login Successful." 
   otherwise, flash a message showing "Incorrect Username/Password".
- 6. If the username is not an email prevent the user from pressing login.
- 7. The page should look decent.  (Perhaps rounded corners, background image/color, drop shadows... it's up to you.)
- 8. Be in one file. (Easier for us to review your work.)

### Install directions
- Install Docker
- "docker-compose up" in project root
- navigate to "localhost"

### Notes
It is likely that I have disqualified myself by not using jQuery and instead using vanilla JavaScript. I also chose to go with the more modern Fetch API.
